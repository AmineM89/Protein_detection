# Protein_detection
In this project, the goal is to develop a Convolutional Graph Network (CGN), using Pytorch, capable of classifying graphs as either representing proteins or not. The dataset utilized is specific to proteins and is structured using the torch_geometric library, which is well-suited for handling graph-based data. Each graph in the dataset is a representation of a protein, with nodes and edges corresponding to distinct features. The CGN model is designed to learn intricate patterns within these graphs, leveraging graph convolutional layers, pooling, and fully connected layers to discern the unique characteristics indicative of proteins. Through a process of training, validation, and testing, the aim is to fine-tune the model's parameters, optimizing its ability to accurately classify protein graphs. The success of the project hinges on achieving a robust and effective model that can generalize well to unseen protein data, contributing to the broader field of computational biology and molecular research.
